In this episode I talked about how much each one needs to study during their college. To become successful out of college doesn't mean that you will have to study everything and spend all day studying. based on your future goals you will have to tune the time that you put into studying college stuff. The earlier you realise this the better it is for your future. So in this podcast developer Tharun talks about his own experience at college.

Welcome to the series of how to make the most out of engineering, each one of this episode we will be looking at each of the aspects that you need to know and improve at college. every minute is precious with that being said four years of college should not be wasted. Thank you so much for listening to the podcast this is Tharun I hope you enjoy episode.
