_Sitting on the terrace, in the shade_<br/>
_Watching the green grasses of blade_

_It's soothingly very sunny and silent_<br/>
_Feeling blissful when I meet the sun's current_

_Can hear my breath flow with the wind_<br/>
_While the clear skies have their blueish tint_

_We're drying the grains under the sun_<br/>
_If you're happy, you've already won_

_I can hear a baby cry from the next door,_<br/>
_He is covered with a mat on the floor_

_I know why I sound suddenly poetic_<br/>
_Its because I currently feel ecstatic_
