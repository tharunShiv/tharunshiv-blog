2. Track your time usage using tools like clockify.
3. Cut away your distractions.
4. In case you're distracted, make sure you come back from it ASAP.

_Few Friends have commented their own tips:_

```md
I ran across the ‚ÄúFour D‚Äôs‚Äù in Tim Allen‚Äôs book ‚ÄúGetting Things Done‚Äù (GTD) and they have really made a
difference over the long term. In brief, they are:

1. Do It: Can you do it now, in the time available? Then do it.
2. Defer It: Not enough time? Put it on the calendar with an appropriate time block.
   Stick to the calendar (this is key).
3. Delegate It: Maybe somebody else should do this task? Assign it. Put time in the calendar
   to circle back for progress. Repeat until done.
4. Drop It: Be honest with yourself. Maybe this is not something that really needs to be done.

Long-term/larger projects require you to schedule time to plan/schedule the work. Two other tips from the book that I use:

1. ‚ÄúMaybe Someday‚Äù Bin: For ideas, tasks, rogue thoughts, etc. that clutter your mind.
2. Time/Place Tagging: When collecting things that need to get done, tag them by ‚Äútime to complete‚Äù and/or
   ‚Äúplace to do this task‚Äù (1 hour, Home). Suddenly have free time? How much? Hit the tag for that timing and choose a task.
   At the grocery store? Hit that tag and never forget that one-off thing you were trying to remember to pick up.
```

**How do you define "distraction"?**

```md
Any activity that doesn't map to your goal.
In the sense, any activity that does not help you move closer to your Goal. üôÇ
