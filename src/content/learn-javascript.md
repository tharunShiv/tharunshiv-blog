## Intro

This is the course where I have put my heart and soul into creating one, which would help a lot of JavaScript fans to learn more about it. In this course, I have covered all the topics that you need to know with the JavaScript ES6 using which you will gain the confidence to learn advanced Frameworks and libraries.

## Why this course?

This is the course content, all that you will learn from the course. I will also be uploading more videos to the course within 2 weeks from the day of request for any videos from the students.
