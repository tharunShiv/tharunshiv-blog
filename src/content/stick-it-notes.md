Hey All!
Tharun Here. I had developed this Stick-it Notes application and hosted it online. Would like to hear feedback on it.

**Purpose of the web app**: To learn

**Features**:

1. Can Add, delete notes
2. Works on Desktop and Mobile Phone responsively
3. Works offline
4. Can be installed on the desktop and mobile phones
5. Personalized to you, the notes you add stays in your phone

**About this application**:

It is a PWA, meaning, a Progressive Web App. One of the current modern powerful ways to build websites. You can read more about PWA here
