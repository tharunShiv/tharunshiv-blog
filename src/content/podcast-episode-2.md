## Intro

When you start doing something there will be a hundred critics, demotivators, competitors on the way. The ones who learn from all these incidents and improve are the only ones who succeed. Success isn't easy.

In this episode dp_says talks about his important Badminton match and what he learned from it for a couple of minutes and then I narrate a motivational story about a painter Panda who is the cousin of Kung Fu Panda. This story was narrated to me by a YouTuber Hitesh Choudhary.

## What do we take away from this Podcast?

_Learn and improve on the critics, but don't ponder on them._

Hope you enjoy this episode.
