## innerText | innerHTML | textContent

All three of them are attributes that you can get from the elements. They are not the same and we will be looking at how they are different with the below illustrations.

## innerText

When applied to an element, it returns only the text which is inside the element, the text part wrapped by the element and nothing else, it also ignores the space.

_syntax:_

```javascript
element.innerText;
```

_example:_

```html
<p id="experiment">
  <br />
  Hello this is <span>Tharun</span> How are you?
  <br />
</p>
```

```javascript
let p = document.getElementById('experiment');
console.log(p.innerText);
```

_output_

```
"
Hello this is Tharun How are you?
"
```

## innerHTML

When applied to an element, it returns the text part enclosed by the element, along with the HTML tags inside, and also considers the spacing given inside. Look at the example below.

_syntax:_

```javascript
element.innerHTML;
```

_example:_

```html
<p id="experiment">
  <br />
  Hello this is <span>Tharun</span> How are you?
  <br />
</p>
```

```javascript
let p = document.getElementById('experiment');
console.log(p.innerHTML);
```

_output_

```
"
  <br>
  Hello this is <span>Tharun<span/> How are you?
  <br>
"
```

## textContent

When applied to an element, it returns the text part enclosed by the element and considers the spacing given inside. Look at the example below.

_syntax:_

```javascript
element.textContent;
```

_example:_

```html
<p id="experiment">
  <br />
  Hello this is <span>Tharun</span> How are you?
  <br />
</p>
```

```javascript
let p = document.getElementById('experiment');
console.log(p.textContent);
```

_output_

```
"

  Hello this is Tharun How are you?

"
```
